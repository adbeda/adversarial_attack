# [Intriguing properties of neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6199.pdf)

#### Key point

Deep neural networks could learn uninterpretable solutions that could have counter-intuitive properties. 

- The first property shows that there is no distinction between individual high level units and random linear combination of high level units.
-  The second property is concerned with the stability of networks with respect to small perturbation to their inputs. 
   -  By applying "imperceptible" non-random peturbation it is possible to arbitrarily change the network's prediction. 
   -  This petrubations are found by **optimizing the input to maximize the prediction error**. 


These properties were tested using MINST, QoucNet and AlexNet.
